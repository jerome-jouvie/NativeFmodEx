 * <BR>
 * Sound description bitfields, bitwise OR them together for loading and describing sounds.<BR>
 * <BR><U><B>Remarks</B></U><BR><BR>
 * By default a sound will open as a static sound that is decompressed fully into memory to PCM. (ie equivalent of FMOD_CREATESAMPLE)<BR>
 * To have a sound stream instead, use FMOD_CREATESTREAM, or use the wrapper function System::createStream.<BR>
 * Some opening modes (ie FMOD_OPENUSER, FMOD_OPENMEMORY, FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT, FMOD_OPENRAW) will need extra information.<BR>
 * This can be provided using the FMOD_CREATESOUNDEXINFO structure.<BR>
 * On Playstation 2, non VAG formats will default to FMOD_SOFTWARE if FMOD_HARDWARE is not specified.<BR>
 * This is due to PS2 hardware not supporting PCM data.<BR>
 * Specifying FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT will POINT to your memory rather allocating its own sound buffers and duplicating it internally.<BR>
 * <b><u>This means you cannot free the memory while FMOD is using it, until after Sound::release is called.</b></u><BR>
 * With FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT, for PCM formats, only WAV, FSB, and RAW are supported.  For compressed formats, only those formats supported by FMOD_CREATECOMPRESSEDSAMPLE are supported.<BR>
 * With FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT and FMOD_OPENRAW or PCM, if using them together, note that you must pad the data on each side by 16 bytes.  This is so fmod can modify the ends of the data for looping/interpolation/mixing purposes.  If a wav file, you will need to insert silence, and then reset loop points to stop the playback from playing that silence.<BR>
 * With FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT, For Wii/PSP FMOD_HARDWARE supports this flag for the GCADPCM/VAG formats.  On other platforms FMOD_SOFTWARE must be used.<BR>
 * <b>Xbox 360 memory</b> On Xbox 360 Specifying FMOD_OPENMEMORY_POINT to a virtual memory address will cause FMOD_ERR_INVALID_ADDRESS<BR>
 * to be returned.  Use physical memory only for this functionality.<BR>
 * FMOD_LOWMEM is used on a sound if you want to minimize the memory overhead, by having FMOD not allocate memory for certain<BR>
 * features that are not likely to be used in a game environment.  These are :<BR>
 * 1. Sound::getName functionality is removed.  256 bytes per sound is saved.<BR>
